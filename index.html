        <h3>kanha kachi ghani</h3>
        <p>In a study published in the International Journal of Molecular Sciences in the year 2018, it has been explained that cold pressed oil i.e. Kachi Ghani oil is rich in nutrients and the reason for this is that this oil is not refined. Since no heat or chemical processing is used during the cold-pressing process, the constituents and medical benefits of cold pressed oil or kachi ghani oil are much higher than other oils. The concentration of antioxidants and phytonutrients such as tocopherols, sterols, stanols, phospholipids and phenolic compounds is very high in crude oil. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are also found in abundance in most raw ghani oil, which is very beneficial for health. These oils are also called fixed or stable oils because this oil does not change at room temperature. However, the presence of antioxidants often leads to auto-oxidation (oxidation caused by oxygen at room temperature) in cold-pressed oil or crude oil, which can result if the oil is not preserved properly. So the shelf-life of the oil (the length of time the oil can be stored and used) gets reduced and it starts spoiling.</p>
